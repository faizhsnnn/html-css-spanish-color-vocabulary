# HTML & CSS Spanish Color Vocabulary

## Overview

This project is a simple frontend exercise that combines HTML structure with basic CSS styling to present Spanish color vocabulary in a clear and visually distinguishable format.

The focus of this project is not design complexity, but correct usage of CSS selectors, asset organization, and the separation of structure (HTML) from presentation (CSS).

Built as part of **#90DaysOfCode**, this project reinforces essential frontend concepts that scale into larger and more complex web interfaces.

- Collaboration in larger projects

This project reinforces disciplined frontend practices before introducing advanced styling or JavaScript.
